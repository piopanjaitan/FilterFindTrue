# FilterFindTrue
FilterFindTrue is a homework assignment of Session 2 React and React Native Basic course by Hacktiv8

## Problem
Filter the following data that has "present = true". Then print how many results and print the results with console.log.
```javascript
const videoData = [
                {
                    name: 'Mis Scarlet',
                    present: true,
                    rooms:[
                        {kitchen: false},
                        {ballroom: false},
                        {conservatory: false},
                        {'dining room': false},
                        {'billiard room': false},
                        {library: false}
                    ]
                },
                {
                    name: 'Mrs. White',
                    present: false,
                    rooms:[
